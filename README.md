Over the course of my short professional career, I have seen that people who are new into the domain of Data Science and Machine Learning generally tend to overlook the importance of **SQL**. In the begining of my carrer, I too was guilty of this mistake.
But on the contrary, it is one of the most important skills that Data Professionals need to master.
<br/>I the past few years, I have have appeared in and taken scads of interviews. In this repository, I would maintain the most important interview questions both conceptual and practical so that I or anyone in need can leverage these before any interview and ace it.
<br/>As i get more and more apt at SQL after using it almost everyday of my life, I will keep on updating the questions according to the level and complexity.
